## Summary & Process
For this assignment, our objective was to create a memory game app. The objective of the game itself is for the user to click on every image without choosing the same image twice. If they choose the same image, the game resets. 

I began this assignment by establishing a static page and populating it with all 12 characters that were "seeded" in a local json file. Next, I created the nav bar and jumbotron and afterwards put together all functionality of the score keeping, image shuffle, high score record keeping, and message switching. The final step was to edit styling (and bootstrap grid) as well as deploying the React app onto GitHub Pages.


## Takeaways
Deploying a React app to GitHub pages does require a few different steps. Be sure to be cautious while navigating this process; things can get tricky rather quickly. The following resources were very helpful:
